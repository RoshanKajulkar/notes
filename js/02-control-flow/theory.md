# Control Flow in JavaScript

Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which the code is executed. It allows us to make decisions and repeat certain tasks based on conditions.

## 1. Conditional Statements

### `if`, `else if`, `else`

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. You can use `else if` to add multiple conditions, and `else` to execute code if none of the previous conditions are met.

#### Syntax:

```js
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
    // Code to execute if the first condition is false and anotherCondition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if all conditions are false
}
```
