# Objects in JavaScript

Objects are collections of key-value pairs. Each key (or property) is a string, and the value can be any data type.

### Object Literal

You can create objects using curly braces `{}`.

```js
const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false,
};
```
