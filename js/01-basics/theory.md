# JavaScript Basics

## 1. Variables and Data Types

### Variables

JavaScript variables are containers for storing data. They are declared using `var`, `let`, and `const`.

-   **`var`**: Declares a variable that can be updated and redeclared. It is function-scoped.
-   **`let`**: Declares a block-scoped variable that can be updated but not redeclared.
-   **`const`**: Declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be updated or redeclared.

#### Example:

```js
var x = 10; // Function-scoped
let y = 20; // Block-scoped
const z = 30; // Block-scoped and immutable
```
