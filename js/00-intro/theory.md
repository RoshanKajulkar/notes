# JavaScript Introduction

JavaScript (JS) is a versatile programming language used for web development, server-side scripting, and more. It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. JS enables dynamic behavior on web pages.

### History of JavaScript

-   Created by Brendan Eich in 1995.
-   Initially designed as a scripting language for web browsers.
-   Standardized as ECMAScript (ES), the current version is ECMAScript 2023.

### Why Learn JavaScript?

-   It is the only programming language native to the browser.
-   It supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming paradigms.
-   Widely used for full-stack development (Node.js).

### Setting Up the Environment

-   **Browser Console**: Every modern browser comes with a built-in JavaScript console. Open the console using `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I`.
-   **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Writing Your First JavaScript Program

Open the console and run the following:

```js
console.log('Hello, JavaScript!');
```
