# JSON in JavaScript

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is primarily used for transmitting data between a server and web application.

## 1. What is JSON?

JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages.

### JSON Structure

-   **Objects**: An unordered collection of key/value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
-   **Arrays**: An ordered collection of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`.

### Example

```json
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "courses": ["Math", "Science"],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Wonderland"
    }
}
```
